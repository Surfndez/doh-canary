1.  Introduction

   Content-control software filters (i.e., blocks) web requests that the
   user, the user's guardian, or the network operator deems
   objectionable or outside the usage policy of the network.  Blocked
   resource categories can include advertisements, explicit content,
   known malware, and government-unapproved material, along with many
   others.

   One way to implement content control that does not rely on software
   or settings on the end-user's computer is DNS-based content
   filtering, which examines a client's initial DNS request for the
   domain providing a resource and then either returns no result or
   returns an alternate result so that the user is presented with an
   explanation that filtering has taken place.

   DNS-based content filtering is often built into a network's
   configured DNS recursive resolver.  In addition to blocking a
   request, the resolver could also log the request for use by the
   network administrators.

   A network operator might wish to provide, or be obligated to provide,
   content filtering to users of its network.  Because such filtering is
   often enforced by the network operator's default resolver, the use of
   a technology such as DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484] or DNS over TLS
   [RFC7858] can result in bypassing local policies.  If the user agent
   can check for the presence of content filtering, this could be used
   as a signal that the network operator wishes its resolver to be used
   as a condition of using the network and that DoH or DoT should be
   disabled.

   At present, there is no standardized mechanism for the user or user
   agent to identify the presence of content filtering on a network

Internet-Draft   DNS Content Filtering Detection Domain        July 2019


   without making a request that could trigger content filtering and
   logging thereof, which could have undesirable side-effects.

   Therefore, this document defines such a mechanism based on a so-
   called "canary domain" that is an instance of Special-Use Domain
   Names [RFC6761].  DNS requests for this domain would return different
   results when DNS-based content filtering is in place, allowing for
   the detection of filtering in a consistent way by user agents.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Design Goals and Constraints

   This canary domain has been defined with the following design goals
   and constraints in mind:

   o  Minimize the risk of exposing personal information

   o  Ensure that the canary request cannot be mistaken for a user-
      initiated DNS request

   o  Ensure that the technique is not specific to any given user agent,
      filtering product, or resolver service

   o  Ensure that the technique is implement for user agents and
      filtering software

4.  Behavior

   Filtering resolvers modify the result for the reserved domain
   'TBD.arpa', which can be observed by clients to determine filtering
   is present.

   If content filtering is present, the filtering resolver MUST return
   NXDOMAIN [RFC1035].  If not present, DNS lookup will be successful
   (i.e. not NXDOMAIN).

5.  Domain Name Reservation Considerations

   This section specifies considerations for systems involved in domain
   name resolution when resolving queries for the reserved domain
   'TBD.arpa', in accordance with [RFC6761].

Internet-Draft   DNS Content Filtering Detection Domain        July 2019


   1.  Users: Users may invoke command-line DNS lookup tools to resolve
       the domain, for the purposes of determining if DNS-based content
       filtering is present.

   2.  Application Software: Application software doing automated
       lookups are the primary targets of this domain name reservation.
       Applications can attempt to resolve this name in order to
       determine if DNS-based content filtering is present.

   3.  Name Resolution APIs and Libraries: Name resolution APIs and
       libraries SHOULD NOT recognize this name as special and SHOULD
       NOT treat it differently.  Name resolution APIs SHOULD send
       queries for this name to their configured caching DNS server(s).

   4.  Caching DNS Servers: Caching servers MUST NOT treat this name as
       special, unless they perform content filtering, in which case
       they MUST return NXDOMAIN.

   5.  Authoritative DNS Servers: Authoritative servers other than those
       supporting the .arpa TLD MUST respond to queries for this name
       with NXDOMAIN.

   6.  DNS Server Operators: Operators SHOULD ensure that any content-
       filtering caching DNS server on their network properly responds
       to this name with NXDOMAIN.

   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars: The defined name is a subdomain of the
       'arpa' top-level domain, which is operated by IANA under the
       authority of the Internet Architecture Board according to the
       rules established in [RFC3172].  There are no other registrars
       for '.arpa'.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to record the domain name 'TBD.arpa.' in the
   "Special-Use Domain Names" registry.  See Section 5 for the completed
   registration template.

   [[NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: please change `TBD` to the name assigned by
   IANA.  The name 'dns-content-filtering-detection' is suggested.]]

7.  Security Considerations

   Although a DNS resolution request for the 'TBD.arpa' domain can
   reveal whether the user or application wishes to detect the presence
   of DNS-based content filtering, such a request is relatively neutral
   compared to a request for a domain that might be subject to such
   filtering.
